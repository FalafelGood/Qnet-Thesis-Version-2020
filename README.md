# Qnet-Thesis-Version-2020

These files constitute Qnet in its current iteration as of Nov 17th 2020 and include the scripts used to perform the experiments in my thesis. For questions, comments, or concerns, please get in touch at << Hudson.T.Leone@uts.student.edu.au >> or << leoneht0@gmail.com >>. The only dependency of Qnet that I'm currently aware of is the NetworkX package. If this proves to be untrue, please let me know and I will correct this statement. This public repository exists exclusively for the right of the honours commitee to view and verify my work up to the aforementioned date. I ask that it not be shared or modified at this time. Thank you for your consideration.
